                "The Desert Door Rest + Resilience Artist Retreat in Joshua Tree was the perfect creative sanctuary. Cozy, beautifully designed and intentionally quiet. The attached movement Studio gave me a spacious, quiet place to dance, meditate and let ideas land in my body. It’s a kind of space that holds you while you work, offering both inspiration and stillness in equal measure."

                "My two residencies at The Desert Door Rest + Resilience Artist Retreat were pivotal to the research I am now engaged in at New York University and in a forthcoming Chocolate Factory Residency. Katherine’s framework as a curator is brilliant in that it gets at the origin of the actual word- to care... Katherine provides gentle, steady guidance while at the residency and in an ongoing relationship with her artists. I could not have birthed this work without her and this residency."
